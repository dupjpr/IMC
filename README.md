# Project "BODY MASS INDEX BMI"

The result is available in the next link: https://dupjpr.github.io/Project-body-mass-index-BMI-/

You will find a small application that allows you to calculate the body mass index. To use the application it is necessary to enter the weight and height of a person.

The application has a modest data entry validation system. A visual alert system was also incorporated that shows the results of the calculation and the final diagnosis in different colors as appropriate.

- Green color alert: Person with a normal BMI (normal weight).
- Yellow alert: Person with a BMI lower or higher than normal (weight slightly above or below normal).
- Red alert: Person with a serious BMI (overweight - obesity).

This is my first personal project using HTML, CSS y JavaScript together.
